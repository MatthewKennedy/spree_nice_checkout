# Spree Nice Checkout

This Spree extension adds a Shopify style checkout to your Spree 3.7 store. Why?
- If you have recently moved from Shopify your existing customers won't notice a huge change.
- Shopify is so wieldy used, so much so that a large percentage of people know the Shopify checkout flow and feel reassured.
- Bypass the default spree registration step that interrupts the checkout flow from cart to checkout.

## ToDo
2. Add Auto country setting to checkout address form via geo detection. (make stores feel native to shopper.)


## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_nice_checkout', github: 'matthewkennedy/spree_nice_checkout'
  ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_nice_checkout:install
  ```

4. Delete checkout and address folder from your spree views folder so the extension views will override.

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_nice_checkout/factories'
```
